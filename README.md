# Talons Scouting Analytics

## Introduction

Talons Scouting Analytics is a software tool designed to analyze scouting data for robotics competitions. This guide provides instructions on how to set up and use the software effectively.

## Software Development

### Requirements

- **Visual Studio Code (Optional):** Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for a more convenient coding experience.
- **g++ (Optional):** Compiler for C++ programs.

### Downloading the Software

You can obtain the software in the following ways:

- Download the software files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your_repository).
- Request a zip file from a developer.
- Download the executable file from the Discord server.

## Usage Instructions

### Matrix 1

- Column 1 represents the team number.
- The remaining columns contain scoring elements.
- The dataset must not have empty rows, non-integers, or strings anywhere besides row 1.
- Matches do not need to be in order, and teams do not need to be assigned an alliance station.

### Matrix 2

Use the following equation to import the scoutless data into the Google Sheet:

```
=IMPORTRANGE("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTyxu_eYq9FKaqx0LkNrmuTAbh2AKvh4GwuM3ht5pgM/edit", "teamData!A:J")
```

Configure the scoutless sheet with the event code. Ensure that the scoutless data (matrix 2) is in the following format. There should be only as many rows as there are teams.:

```
Team Climb, Park, Leave
```

### Download Scouting Data

Access both Matrix tabs of 5232's Scouting Google Sheet.

### Place CSV Files

Ensure the downloaded CSV files are in the same directory (folder) as `run.exe`.

### Run the Program

Execute the `run.exe` file by double-clicking on it. Follow the prompts to input the necessary CSV files and data.

### Usage Notes

- The `run.exe` should be in the same directory (folder) as the CSV files.
- The software attempts to check for bad data (e.g., non-numeric values, empty lines), but manual inspection might be required.
- Create a new Google Sheet from the scouting master sheet. Examples of `matrix1` and `matrix2` are in the main directory of this GitHub page.
